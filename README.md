# ComixProject-262
Class project from Intro to Software Engineering Subsystems (SWEN-262) 

# Description
Worked in a team of 4 to develop a full-stack application for a Comix app using Java. The goal of the project was to create an application to be a central place for someone to track their collection of comic books. The app supports browsing, searching, and sorting a large database along with a user's personal collection. The application also has user authentication, persistence, a basic user interface implemented using JavaFX, file importation and exportation, and a variety of subsystems that were used to implement various requirements. I was primarily in charge of testing and took the lead in the design and implementation of the import/export features, as well as helping out with the PTUI for earlier iterations. 

Throughout this project, I greatly improved my ability to set up a design and create an outline to make implementation seamless. I used both class and UML diagrams and focused on more noun/verb analysis than I have in the past, and found it extremely helpful when it came time to implement. I also used a Trello board to track projects with my team and utilized virtual standups to work remotely.

THIS PROJECT IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT WHATSOEVER. It was done in short windows of time to show we were grasping concepts learned in class. The program can be improved an several different areas.
